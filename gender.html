            <h2>Patriarchal Society</h2>
    
            <p>&emsp;Ancient Greece was a society deeply rooted in patriarchal ideologies. Since ancient Greek society was mainly 
                influenced by the myths surrounding their pantheon of gods and goddesses, the Greeks view of women is low 
                because in their mythology, they blame women for the downfall of men. Despite Athens having the first known 
                democracy in the world, beginning around 595 BCE, that democracy was different compared to what we view 
                democracy as today.  Since women were viewed as less than men, women were not given the privilege of becoming 
                Athenian citizens. Instead, the privilege of becoming a citizen was granted to free, native-born, adult men.<a href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
            </p>
    
    
            <p>&emsp;The Greek patriarchy was oppressive to women and would cause them to be secluded and tied to the household. 
                Athenian Greek society created this dichotomy between the two sexes because the Greeks had certain genders 
                ascribed to certain parts of society. Most traditional Mediterranean societies associated women with private 
                life such as the household, and men were associated with public spheres, meaning markets, business, and 
                politics.<a href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> 
            </p>
    
            <p>&emsp;Athenian philosophers had a great deal of influence on ancient Greek society due to their published works of 
                higher thinking and ideas. Aristotle, 384 BCE - 322 BCE, was one such philosopher. At this time, men were largely, 
                if not all, those who took up the study of philosophy, which subsequently perpetuated more patriarchal ideologies. 
                For example, in his work <span style="font-style: italic">Politics</span> (p. 350 BCE), Aristotle writes, "the freeman rules over the slave after another 
                manner from that in which the male rules over the female, or the man over the child; although the parts of the soul 
                are present in all of them, they are present in different degrees."<a href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>  In nearly every aspect of ancient Athenian life, 
                gender roles were expected because of the strong presence of the patriarchy.

            <h2 style="font-style: italic;">Women's Presence in Greek Philosophy</h2>
    
            <p>
                &emsp;While many of the Greek philosophers were men, some women, elevated by their status and position, would get into those intellectual conversations. One of these women was 
                Aspasia, born around 470 BCE, she was later married to Pericles, the ruler of Athens (ruling dates: 461 - 429 BCE). The end of Pericles rule was marked by the Plague of 
                Athens (roughly from 430 BCE to 426 BCE). Aspasia's social rank made it easy for her to be friends with some of the most influential men in Athens including Socrates and 
                Xenophon. It is remarked that the love between Aspasia and Pericles was one of the few recorded romantic loves at the time. Unfortunately, Aspasia was not an Athenian native, 
                and she had a questionable sexual life, which constantly endangered her reputation and position. However, Aspasia used this to her advantage and brought new thinkers, artists, 
                and atheists so her salon and because of this many Athenians believed her to be a woman of great beauty and intellect, considering her one of the many female philosophers 
                hidden from history.<a href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>

            <h2>Domestic Life</h2>
    
            <p>
                &emsp;Beginning with marriage, the Greek family life was often arranged by the bride and groom's family. For women, the marrying age was typically around 14 and 15 and were 
                often paired with husbands around 30 years old. Love matches between men and women were uncommon as it was expected that the husband takes on a mistress and romantic love was 
                reserved for that role.<a href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
            </p>
    
            <p>
                &emsp;Within the house itself, there were usually three main areas to a home: the courtyard, the men's hall, and the women's hall. The men's hall was the main part of the 
                house, where the hearth was located and most of the cooking (done by the women) would take place. If the head of the household had other men over, women were expected to 
                vacate to their hall which was usually on the upper floor.<a href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The women's rooms were children were cared for and it acted as the women's sleeping quarters.

            <p>
                &emsp;To be a respectable woman in ancient Athens, she should be married and stay home to take care of the children. These duties often meant that women were secluded from the 
                public sphere. Although, this does not mean that these women failed to find their own agency and relationships outside of the home. According to Claire Taylor in 
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Women's Social Networks and Female Friendship in the Ancient Greek City</span>, friendships between women at this time prove difficult to study because These bonds between women could have 
                looked different than that of a man's idea as Taylor writes, "Perhaps one reason why women's relationships have been overlooked is because the types of social networks in 
                which these were fostered were not like men's. They are certainly more difficult to detect in our source material, which might indicate (aside from not being valued) that 
                they were more informal."<a href="#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>  Ancient Athenian women did not receive the same social benefits which networking granted to men. Women were not allowed citizenship and thus had no 
                political impact, meaning they would not have needed friendships that would gain votes in the senate. Markets were also a male-dominated sphere and women did not need to 
                maintain relationships with clients to build business.
