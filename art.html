                <h2>A Shift in Art</h2>

                <p>
                    &emsp;Following the defeat of the Persians in 479 BCE, the archaic art period that had been going on since 600 BCE finally ended in 480 BCE. During 550 BCE, also called the 
                    golden age of Athens<a href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, a major shift in techniques for attic vase painting occurred such as adopting a red-figure style instead of the typical black-figure style, 
                    allowing for greater detail when depicting the human body, movement, and clothes<a href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. This art was typically put on vessels with the role of mixing water and wine 
                    (kraters), holding water (hydriaie), holding wine (Stamnos), and drinking cups (kylix). While the red-figure painting technique continued to be popular for pottery, 
                    a new style of art erupted during the Classical art period (480-323 BCE), this being sculptures in the form of statues, steles (grave monuments), and integration into 
                    buildings such as the Parthenon. Steles typically displayed the dead, gods/goddesses, or their family while pottery such as oil bottles (Lekythos) were decorated with 
                    funerary scenes and would be placed into the tomb of many men.

                <h2>The Parthenon's Vast Collection of Sculptures</h2>

                <p>
                    &emsp;The Athenian Parthenon was constructed between 447 and 438 BCE as a place to worship the goddess of wisdom and war Athena, and while the building was finished in 
                    438 BCE, artwork done by the artist Pheidias was not completed until 432 BCE. Other than its sheer size, the white marble construction accentuated the wealth and 
                    power of the empire. Its grand location was the centerpiece of a large building project of the Acropolis that would take many years to finish. Observing the outside 
                    structure of the Parthenon, there are three major sculpture categories, these being the Frieze, Metopes, and Pediment. These sculptures differ mostly in shape and 
                    location, the Frieze is a long strip of carved sculptures that lined all four sides of the Parthenon and featured the citizens of Athens performing religious 
                    procession. This differed from the ninety-two Metopes as they were rectangular slabs lining the outside opening leading into the temple and depicted battles between 
                    gods and giants, and centaurs and Lapiths (Humans). The pediment is the outermost section of the Parthenon as each end contains a triangular section that encloses the 
                    roof, it is also similar to the Metopes in its sculptures as it also displays Greek myths such as the moon goddess Selene<a href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. The inside featured two rooms, the larger 
                    being named Hekatompedon and housing a massive ivory and gold statue of Athena. On the other hand, the smaller room is where the name of the Parthenon came from and 
                    was thought to be a sort of vault that was the Athenian treasury<a href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.
