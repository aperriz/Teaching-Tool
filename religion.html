                <p>
                    &emsp;Greek religion, popularly known as Greek mythology, encompasses a vast collection of stories depicting gods, goddesses, heroes, and mythical creatures. These stories played a critical role in the Greek culture.

                <p>
                    &emsp;When speaking about these gods, we must travel many years back in time. These gods were originally worshipped in places like Spain and Afghanistan. When the popularization of the Greek language arose, these names were translated. Many of these translated names held meaning in their translations. Aphros in Aphrodite means foam, equating her name to her birth, which took place in the sea. Kore was translated to Persephone. Agesilas and Agesilaos were both names that were changed to Hades. Phoibos became Apollo and Pallas became Athena.

                <h2 style="width:60%">Who Were These Gods?</h2>

                <p>
                    &emsp;The main gods that ruled over the world were Zeus the god of the sky, Hades the god of the underworld, and Poseidon the god of the sea.  
                    The land was split of equal rule between them. There were many other gods that specialized in different aspects of life. Some included,
                    Cronos was the god of times, Hymenaios was the god of marriage ceremonies, Hypnos was the god of sleep, and Zeus who is the god of the sky and king of the gods. 
                    Many of these gods had similar powers like immortality but each had a special powers only they held. Similar powers were shared between Zeus and Poseidon, both 
                    being able to manipulate the weather. Another shared power amongst some was the ability to shapeshift. Zeus was most well known for using this ability, 
                    allowing him to befriend, seduce, and later impregnate goddesses and mortal women alike. This is one of the reasons Zeus was able to 
                    so many children who were human, deities, or a hybrid of both.

                <h2>How were the Gods related?</h2>

                <p>
                    &emsp;Most of the gods were related by blood all relating to Chaos, the god of nothingness. Being that most of these gods were related by blood, all the children were products of what is now considered incest.

                <p>
                    &emsp;Zeus in particular has dozens of children. Some reports say he had up to 90 children and about 40 of them were considered divine beings. Athena, the goddess of war, was said to be his favorite child. Athena’s birth is said to be one of the most bizarre births in Greek mythology. It is said that Athena burst out of Zeus’s head, fully grown, protected by armor, and ready for battle. Persephone was another offspring of Zeus, Demeter being her mother. Persephone was kidnapped by her uncle, Hades, and then became his wife. The event is what the Greeks believed was the reason for the changes in the seasons. When Persephone was in the presence of her mother 6 months out of the year, that was the time of great harvest due to Demeter being the god of agriculture. The other 6 months of the year, Demeter was saddened by her daughter's absence, causing the autumn and winter months, eliminating the ability to grow crops.

                <h2>What was the War of the Titans</h2>

                <p>
                    &emsp;The War of the Titans began long before the birth of Zeus and before the creation of humanity. It began when Cronus, Zeus’s father rebelled against his father Uranus by cutting off his testicles with a scythe. In his rage Uranus cursed his son, saying that Cronus’s children would rebel against him just like he did with his father. Fearing his children's revolt, Cronus would eat all his children. Fearing for her child Rhea tricked her husband into eating a rock while hiding away her new child Zeus. When Zeus became full-grown, he returned to his father to get his siblings back. Zeus forced Cronus to throw up his siblings and they joined together to overthrow the Titans. With the Olympians' win over the Titans, their allies, the cyclopes, made some of the most memorable weapons in Olympian history, Zeus’s thunderbolts, Hades’ helmet, and Poseidon’s trident. Zeus then became the king of the gods. In 174 BC a temple named the Temple of Olympian Zeus was built in his honor.

                <h2>How did the Gods influence Greece?</h2>

                <p>
                    &emsp;There were many aspects of life that were influenced by the belief of the gods and goddesses. From literature and art to natural weather events.  One of the most popular celebrations is The Olympics. This originally began as a celebration to honor Zeus, being that whoever wins in the games wins the attention of the gods for their home. Their everyday life was also affected by the gods. Their prayers and worship toward Demeter were said to bring a good harvest. Hephaestus was said to bless mankind with fire, furthering their evaluation. Many women believed that Hera blessed them with successful marriages and kept them safe during childbirth. Many temples were built to commemorate these gods some being The Erechtheion in 421 BC, dedicated to Athena and Poseidon. The Temple of Athena Nike was built around 420 BC during the Peloponnesian war, is named after Athena. In 437 BC the Propylaia was built, being the entrance of the Acropolis, and included a giant statue of Athena.  Lastly, the Theatre of Dionysus was built. It was originally made from wood but was remodeled to be made of stone in 390 BC. This was dedicated to Dionysus who was the god of wine and theater.
