                <h2>Influence on Trade</h2>

                <p>
                    &emsp;Ancient Greece had an extraordinary economic system that was based around trade. By the 6th B.C. and into the 4th the Greeks were systematic traders. Many valuable 
                    commodities that were sought after across the world came from Greece. Olive Oil, which was a base, used for medicines and other ointment was later introduced into 
                    trade around neighboring countries in 600 B.C. Wine was also a high commodity in Greece and offered them high trade power because of its value and their abundance

                    A big everyday used product in ancient Greece was pottery and clay materials. Through the daily transportation of water, olive oil, and grain, it was often used to 
                    trade for high grade materials to Greek craftsman. Trading pottery with foreign countries also resulted in foreign designs on the pots. This opened new alternatives 
                    to art styles for the countries to use. Mining was common in Greece and many fine ore mines were manufactured. The Greeks would use exotic gems to make fine jewelry 
                    and goblets for them to drink out of. These metals also assisted Greece in making its first universal coinage system. The first common banking system also opened in 
                    Greece around 400 B.C.<a href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

                <h2>Finance of Greece</h2>

                <p>
                    &emsp;Though trade was not easy because of the lack of land routes of Greece they found a way to maneuver the seas. The Greek people loaded fleets aboard set to Egypt, 
                    Italy, Libya, and other countries filled with goods. Slave trade was a common way to pay for goods as many were captured wars or pirating<a href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. After the military 
                    campaign of Alexander, the Great from 336-323 B.C. many more trade networks were opened across Asia all the way to Afghanistan and the Indus Valley.

                    &emsp;Though we may think the tax system is bad in our country the ancient Greek’s seemed to have it worse. In 4 B.C. Athens there was a tax called a liturgy that 
                    affected the sole 1 top percent of the wealthiest population. They were then forced to pay for the provisions, wages, and supplying warfare for an entire year. 
                    Surprisingly the Athenian people were proud of paying these taxes and used it as a boasting right.
