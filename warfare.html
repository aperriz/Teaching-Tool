                <h1>Warfare</h1>
    
            <h2>Wars and Battles</h2>
    
            <p>Ancient Greece was a warmongering region, with an almost constant state of war. While there were many wars fought over the almost 900 years that ancient Greece existed, 
                a few stand out amongst the rest. These wars were 
                often different in the way that they were fought against an external power. 
                Many of the battles fought during these times shaped the future of the world and military tactics.</p>
    
            <h3>Battle of Marathon (490 BCE)</h3>

            <p>The Battle of Marathon is widely considered one of the most important battles in ancient Greece. This battle occurred during the first Persian war, when the Persians, 
                under the rule of king Darius, invaded ancient Greece in an attempt to enslave the Greek people. After finding out about the Persian’s intentions, Athenian and 
                Platean forces joined to meet the Persians on the beaches in the city of Marathon<sup><a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></sup>. In this battle, a tactic known as flanking was used, in which the greatly outnumbered 
                Greeks surrounded the invading Persian forces, reducing the effectiveness of their number advantage. This tactic is still used in modern warfare, with many of the 
                greatest victories in history utilizing it.

            <h3>Battle of Thermopylae (Late Summer, 480 BCE)</h3>

                Perhaps the most well known battle fought by the ancient Greeks, the Battle of Thermopylae was an incredible feat of military strength and endurance. 
                Often known for the number of Greek warriors who initially held the passage, being just 300 Spartan hoplites, in which the battle took place, it has shown the importance of 
                positioning and timing of attacks on a seemingly weaker force. With the Greeks being outnumbered at an estimated 3,000 to 1 odds<sup><a href="#footnote_2">[2]</a></sup>, they were 
                still able to hold the passage of Thermopylae for an estimated 2 days. This battle also showed the importance of quality over quantity, with the well 
                armored and armed Greeks only falling due to a lack of flank security. Eventually, the Persian forces led by king Xerxes I took advantage of this lapse, 
                and surrounded the Greeks.

            <h3>Battle Of Salamis (Spetember, 480 BCE)</h3>

            <p>Occuring just a month after the Battle of Thermopylae, the Battle of Salamis was a last stand effort by the Athenians. Athens itself had been razed shortly before the battle,
                causing the people to flee to the island of Salamis. The Persian navy of an estimated 600 to 1000 ships<sup><a href="#footnote_3">[3]</a></sup> blocked off the channel leading to the island. As the 
                ships approached the island however, they were met with the remainder of the Athenian navy, who proceded to back away, drawing the Persians closer. Once the larger navy was within a short distance of
                the Athenians, the Athenian ships rammed the Persians at full speed. This battle was a catasrophic loss for the Persians, destroying a good amount of their navy and weakening their grip on ancient
                Greece.

            <h3>Battle Of Plataea (479 BCE)</h3>
            
            <figure >

            </figure>

            <p>The Battle of Plataea took place between the remaining forces of ther Persian army and the Greek aliance. In this battle, the Greeks were cut off from their supplies, and proceded to 
                pull back in order to restore the line.<sup><a href="#footnote_4">[4]</a></sup> Seeing this, the Persians charged what they assumed to be retreating Greeks. As the Persian cavalry reached the Greeks, the combined forces fought back.
                The Greeks pushed through the Persian lines, killing their commander. The rest of the Persian troops then retreated, ending the first Persian War.

            <h3>Hoplites (Early 7th Century BCE)</h3>

            <p>Hoplites were heavily armored foot soldiers who fought for Ancient Greece. Originally appearing in the early 7th century, they composed the majority of the standing Greek armies. 
                These soldiers wore bronze armor<sup><a href="footnote_5">[5]</a></sup> and were equipped with spears or swords, increasing their effectiveness in close range combat while maintaining endurance. 
                The strong qualities of brass also allowed for arrows to bounce off, decreasing the effectiveness of enemy archers. 
                During their time of prominence, hoplites were a feared fighting force able to take on large odds against them.</p>

            <p id="pHeading">Phalanx Formation (Mid 8th Century BCE)</p>

            <figure id="phalanxFig">
    
                <img src="images/warfare/phalanx.jpg" alt="Greek Phalanx Formation" id="phalanx">

            </figure>
            
            <p>The ancient Greek phalanx formation, which was first mentioned in Homer’s Iliad<sup><a href="#footnote_6">[6]</a></sup> in the mid 8th century BCE, was a very powerful formation that reduced number influence. While in this formation, 
                troops were covered on almost every side by a shield, allowing very little to get through the wall-like structure formed by them. Archers proved all but useless against this formation, with the 
                shields blocking most arrows that were fired. The phalanx was also very effective when used in melee combat, with members using spears in order to stab enemies while not being in as much danger themselves. 
                Along with the durability of the Greek equipment, the phalanx allowed for relatively small armies to defend from much larger forces.
