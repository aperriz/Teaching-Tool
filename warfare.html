                <p> &emsp;Ancient Greece was a warmongering region, with an almost constant state of war. 
                    These conflicts were caused by a variety of circumstances, however most of them were in a quest for power or to settle a disagreement. 
                    The large unions of the area - one led by Athens, one led by Sparta - were almost always in conflict. This did not however stop the ancient Greeks from 
                    banding together when their homes were threatened.

                <h2 id = "mHeading">Battle Of Marathon</h2>
                <p>&emsp;When the Persian Empire, ruled by King Darius, invaded the Greek homelands, the Spartan and Athenian coalitions joined forces. While outnumbered greatly, 
                    the Greeks had superior tactics and equipment compared to the Persian forces. The Battle of Marathon in 490 BCE, which was considered the turning point of the war,
                     was an awesome display of this matter. In this battle, the overwhelming forces of the Persians landed on a beach in the city of Marathon<a href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The greatly outnumbered 
                     Greeks used a tactic to limit the effectiveness of the number discrepancy by flanking the Persian forces from either side. Along with the well trained hoplite 
                     forces of the Greek army, first seen in the early 7th century BCE, this tactic worked wonderfully for the Greeks, leading to them winning the battle despite all 
                     odds. This was also in part to the difference in equipment between the forces, with Greek hoplites wearing bronze armor<a href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. In comparison, the Persian forces wore 
                     padded tunics, leaving them at a strong disadvantage as the Greek soldiers could take a lot more punishment. As a direct result of this battle, the Persian 
                     forces retreated to Asia, ending their invasion of Greece.

                <p>&emsp;The difference in tactics and equipment was seen once again during the second Persian war. One of the most prominent battles of the war, 
                    the Battle of Thermopylae in the summer of 480 BCE, was a show of quality versus quantity. While this battle was lost by the Greeks, the 300 Spartan Hoplites 
                    who held the passage at an estimated 3000 to 1 odds<a href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> were able to maintain their barrier for an estimated 2 days. Their superior armor and use of the phalanx 
                    formation allowed them to hold out for an incredible amount of time, only being defeated when a pass around them was found by the Persian forces, who promptly 
                    flanked them from behind. The phalanx formation (seen right), first mentioned in Homer’s <span style="font-style: italic">Illiad</span><a href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> during the mid 8th century BCE, was formed by having spear-wielding 
                    Hoplites closely grouped together in order to have more weapons in the fight. This also allowed for improved resistance against arrows, having a shield on each 
                    soldier. These shields would be stacked, removing any frontal arrow weakness.

                <p>&emsp;Around a month after the Battle of Thermopylae, in September of 480 BCE, the Battle of Salamis took place. 
                    This battle took place as the remaining Athenians fled their home after Athens’ destruction. The Persian forces followed the Athenians to the small island of 
                    Salamis, where the estimated 600 to 1,000 Persian ships<a href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> blockaded and advanced on the Athenians. The small remaining Athenian navy lured the Persian ships close, 
                    and then used their boats to ram the larger navy. The Athenian forces destroyed the majority of the Persian navy before the Persians retreated. As a direct result 
                    of this battle, the second invasion of Greece was nearly halted, as the majority of the Persian forces retreated to Asia, fearing the bridge that connected the 
                    2 would be destroyed. Under the order of King Xerxes I however, a unit of elite cavalry and infantry remained on the Greek side to continue their conquest.

                <h2 id="plateaHeading" style="width:60%">Battle of Plataea</h2>

                <p>
                    &emsp;As the unit of elite troops pushed farther inland into Greece in 479 BCE, the Greeks formed an alliance and gathered all of the troops they could spare to face 
                    the Persians. Once getting within sight of each other, both sides had set up camp and were waiting. The Persians used this opportunity to cut off the Greek supply 
                    line that kept the troops fed and healthy<a href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. In response, the Greeks decided to pull back during the night in order to reestablish it. The Persians, seeing this as 
                    the Greeks retreating, charged. As the Persian Cavalry reached the Greeks, the lines crashed, with the Greeks pushing through far enough to kill the commander of 
                    the unit. This demoralized the Persians, ending the land invasion of Greece and the second Persian war.
